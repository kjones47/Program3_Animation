# Program3_Animation

Either Android or iOS... Move something around. Breakout is easy to do. Asteroids is easy to do. Pong is easy to do. Use LibGDX if you like on Android, or run your own timer. SpriteKit is a great way to go on iOS.
Make it game-like. It doesn't have to be pretty, or even fun to play. The goal is to get some experience building something that has animation, and coding it from the ground up.
